Lines below are written at the end of CO expriment.

When failing P4 for the second time, I have no room for errors because of my mistakes in the last P3 and P4.
In desperate, I even began to question my ability and suitablility for CS.
But after adjustment, I repick my confidence and became peaceful for P5, P6 and P7.
Fortunately, the author passed all the seven exams with ups and downs.

If you are a sophomore in BUAA especially in 6, what I wanna convey is just believing in yourself.
Don't be afraid of failing a certain exam!

Wish you good luck!
